5.2 JOB APPLICATION WEBSITES AND PORTALS
Since our Service’s main feature is scraping job offers and automatically filling in applications when you consent, your personal data (such as your resume, name, and contact details) may be shared with third-party job sites or employers to submit your application.

7. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
Your information, including personal data, may be processed in countries other than the one in which you reside. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those of your country.

9. SECURITY OF YOUR DATA
We take reasonable security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. However, no data transmission over the internet or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

10. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
Our Service may contain links to other websites or services that we do not operate. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site.
